# FinalPartIII

This will serve as a broad outline of my final project which is posted publicly on 
<a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/tPmkQv7NnmhSY1Ix">Shorthand</a>. You can reach my Part I at this link.
  
## Part I Summary -- The link above has the complete details 

In <a href="https://cspivey00.github.io/Final_Project_ChristianSpivey/">Part I</a> of our project I created an outline of the framing and story arc. 

A brief summary is that I wanted to create a digital visualization of Permanent Residents in the United States using Department of Homeland Security Data, primarily focusing on 2018 for contemporary data. 

## One Sentence Summary

Immigration is critical part of the US economic and cultural growth and we should advocate for better immigration policies to enhance the number of immigrants into the United States.

##What should Readers Understand

My thought process is that the immigration system has been a controversial topic in the last decade, and that the US Congress should create a better immigration system that works more efficienctly. We are seeing stagnated levels of immigration which doesn't reflect the level of populatiion growth worldwide or amount of immigrant applications to the United States.

In short, I would like to convey why the topic of immigration is important and advocate for improving our immigration policies.

## Call to Action

My call to action is twofold. First, I would like to ask people to donate or volunteer with AJAPO -- a local pittsburgh immigration organization. Second, I would like to ask people to be politically active and reach out to their local and state representatives. 

### Part II 

My part II data sketches, wire framing, and interviews are linked <a https://cspivey00.github.io/Part-II-Wireframe-Test/">here</a>.

### Part III

A few paragraphs that talk about the intended audience for your final data story.  Include any personas and / or other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus.  Talk about specific things you did to your final project to make it work for your audience. 

I remade some of the graphs to be easier to digest -- IE: the annual immigration graph that shows the stagnation of permanent residents annually over the last three decades or the interactive permanent residents by state. I also needed to really dial in to one specific group of immigrants -- permanent residents -- so that the information was more digestible. I found it difficult to demonstrate the origin - destination relationship even with the alluvial graph which need to be broken down into two seperate graphs to really be able to understand the information.
